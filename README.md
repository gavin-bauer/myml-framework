**MyML Framework** is a personal machine learning framework to automate the implementation of models, including the preprocessing steps by _trying different algorithms and topologies, to minimize error when the model is used on test data._

This project is still in its early stages as:
- The data is assumed to have already been collected, cleaned and prepared (as the project was tested on Kaggle datasets);
- The author is experimenting with modular programming (vs. notebooks);
- The implementation of a GUI after deployment will be added in the future.

<br/>

## The project structure

The main app is located in the _src_ folder which itself is divided in:
- _data_ contains the scripts to download the datasets;
- _features_ contains the scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling;
- _models_ contains the scripts to train models and then use trained models to make predictions.

## Installation

#### Downloading & editing the app

1. Clone the repository with the 'clone' command, or just download the zip.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:https://github.com/gavin-bauer/myml-framework.git
```

2. Install the requirements.

3. Download or Open your IDE (i.e. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and start editing the files in _src_.

#### User guide

1. **Downloading and preprocessing datasets**: Open the 3 Python scripts in the folders _data_ and _features_, fill the path variables. In the terminal, run the scripts in their numerical order using the following command:

```
python src/[sub_folder]/[script_name].py
```

2. **Benchmark models**: Open _dispatcher.py_ and fill the _MODELS_ dictionary. For each model, use the name of the algorithm as the _key_, and the scikit-learn function corresponding to the model as the _value_ (e.g. "SVC": svm.SVC(kernel="linear")). Then, in the terminal, run the following command:

```
sh run.sh
```

3. **Training, finetuning and testing a model**: Open _run.sh_, comment the last 4 lines except the script you want to run (depending whether you would like to train, finetune or test a model). Then, rerun the above command in the terminal.
